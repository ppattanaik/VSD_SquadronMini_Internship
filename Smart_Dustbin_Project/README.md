# Smart Dustbin Project
## Introduction
Trash bins, whether termed dustbins, garbage receptacles, or trash cans, serve as essential containers for temporarily housing waste in a variety of settings, including households, workplaces, public spaces, and outdoor areas. They fulfill a vital role in waste management, particularly in regions where littering is prohibited, serving as the primary means for disposing of small waste items. 
Traditionally, waste segregation practices often involve the use of separate bins for wet and dry waste, as well as for recyclable and non-recyclable materials, contributing to efficient waste management and recycling efforts.
## Overview
The Smart Dustbin project showcased here introduces an innovative solution utilizing Arduino technology, an Ultrasonic Sensor, and a Servo Motor. Its core functionality lies in its ability to autonomously open the lid of the dustbin upon detecting the presence of a human hand.
Central to the project is the principle of object detection, a concept previously applied in projects such as the Object Avoiding Robot. Here, an Ultrasonic Sensor is strategically placed atop the dustbin's lid. When the sensor detects an object, such as a human hand, it triggers the Arduino to activate the Servo Motor, thereby initiating the lid-opening mechanism.
This technology-driven approach offers a hands-free and user-friendly solution for waste disposal, potentially enhancing hygiene and sanitation practices across various settings. Its implementation holds promise for streamlining waste management processes and fostering a cleaner and more sustainable environment.
